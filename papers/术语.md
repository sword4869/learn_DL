## 杂

re-training vs. fine-tuning: re-training 指从头开始训练，fine-tuning指与训练好的再微调一下。二者不可混为一谈。

unstructured 2D image collections: 没有外参

## a collection of images

表示可以处理某一类的图片。人的、猫的。可以泛化，但只能泛化一点点。

## texture sticking

styleGAN2有问题，coarse features tend to control the presence of finer details but their location is nailed to specific pixel coordinates。

例如体现在，转动人脸，胡子固定不动。

![GRAM-HD: 3D-Consistent Image Generation at High Resolution with Generative Radiance Manifolds # fig5](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sword4869/pic1@main/images/202407062014433.png)

For 3D-consistent generation, the resultant spatiotemporal texture should appear smooth and natural. Figure 5 shows that the resultant texture image of StyleNeRF contain both distorted and noisy regions, indicating both low-frequency inconsistency and high-frequency texture flicking. The line texture from StyleSDF barely changes across views, indicating the texture sticking artifact [23]. EG3D’s spatiotemporal texture also contains some non-smooth, high-frequency patterns which are caused by texture flicking. In contrast, the texture from GRAM-HD appears natural with no noticeable noise or distortion, demonstrating its strong 3D consistency.

EPI斜线弯弯曲曲的，是texture flicking；EPI是竖线，texture sticking；EPI是平滑的斜线，善。
