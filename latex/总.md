Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose GaussianAvatars, a method to create animatable head avatars by rigging 3D Gaussians to parametric mesh models. 

\item We design a binding inheritance strategy to support adding and removing 3D Gaussians without losing controllability.
\end{itemize}
