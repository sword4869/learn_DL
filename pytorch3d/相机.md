## look_at_view_transform

```python
from pytorch3d.renderer import (
    look_at_view_transform,
    FoVPerspectiveCameras, 
)

# def look_at_view_transform(
#     dist: _BatchFloatType = 1.0,          # distance of the camera from the object
#     elev: _BatchFloatType = 0.0,          # 俯仰角：从物体到相机的向量，与水平面的角度。正负表示+z/-z上下方向。
#     azim: _BatchFloatType = 0.0,          # 水平角：从物体到相机的向量在水平面的投影向量，与+z的角度。210°等同-150°，+-的方向没搞清。

#     up=((0, 1, 0),),  # (1, 3)			# 相机的up方向，默认+y
#     device: Device = "cpu",
# ) 
# With world coordinates +X left, +Y up and +Z in
# the front of the cow is facing the -Z direction， So we move the camera by 180 in the azimuth direction so it is facing the front of the cow. 
R, T = look_at_view_transform(2.7, 0, 180) 
cameras = FoVPerspectiveCameras(device=device, R=R, T=T)
```

```python
R, T = look_at_view_transform(at=((0.0, 0.0, 0), ),
                              eye=((0.0, 0.0, 3.0), ),

## CamerasBase

相机的父类，所有相机都有的共有方法：

![请添加图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/blog_migrate/3b79aa4230aeb77d909e7063faab2b7e.png)

- `transform_points` 

  Transform input points from world to camera space.

  - If camera is defined in NDC space, the projected points are in NDC space.

  - If camera is defined in screen space, the projected points are in screen space.

    which takes a set of points in world coordinates and projects to **NDC** coordinates ranging from [-1, -1, znear] to [+1, +1, zfar].

- `transform_points_ndc` 
  
    which takes a set of points in world coordinates and projects them to PyTorch3D's **NDC space**
    
- `transform_points_screen` 
  
    which takes a set of points in world coordinates and projects them to the **screen coordinates** ranging from [0, 0, znear] to [W, H, zfar]

- `get_camera_center`
  
    returns the optical center of the camera in world coordinates

- `get_world_to_view_transform`
  
    returns a 3D transform from world coordinates to the camera view coordinates **(R, T)**

  from world -> ndc
  
- `get_projection_transform`

  **（K）**，由子类来实现。

- `get_full_projection_transform` 

    which composes the projection transform **(K)** with the world-to-view transform **(R, T)**

    from world -> ndc

- `get_ndc_camera_transform` 

    provides the transform from **screen to NDC** space in PyTorch3D
    - If the camera is defined in NDC space, then the identity transform is returned. 
    - If the cameras is defined in screen space, the conversion from screen to NDC is returned. 

    - If users define their own camera in screen space, they need to think of the screen to NDC conversion. 

    is called when interfacing with the PyTorch3D renderer.
